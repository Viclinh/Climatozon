## Inspiration
Hoboken is vulnerable to climate changes caused by greenhouse gas emission that brings rising sea levels, more frequent and intense storm events, higher temperatures, and longer heat waves. Further, rising levels of greenhouse gases can be traced to solid waste. The manufacture, distribution, and use of products-as well as management of the resulting waste-all result in greenhouse gas emissions. 

We want to build an app that can track green house gas emission to let people know about the amount of gas they produce. We also want to educate people about climate change, waste management, and greenhouse gas emission. 

## What it does
- Carbon Footprint Calculator: Develop a carbon footprint calculator to make people aware of the carbon amount they produce.
- Waste Classifier Model: Allow people to upload photos about waste in their houses and classify if the waste can be recycled or not 
- Educate about Recycling: Educate people how to recycle waste in their houses
- Chat bot: Chat bot teaches people about waste,  which items can be recycled, climate change, and greenhouse gas emission.

## How we built it
- Google Cloud: We built our chatbot in Google Cloud
- Artificial Intelligent, Natural Processing Language: We used NLP and AI to develop our chatbot language
- tensorflow: We used tensorflow to develop the image classification model for waste
- Python
- HTML 
- CSS
- Javascript

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to debug errors and bring everything to work properly in a limited amount of time

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We were able to build the chatbot that educates people about greenhouse emission and climate change
- We were able to build  AI model to classify waste 
- We designed our website 

## What we learned
- We learnt about building AI model to classify waste 
- We learnt to design our website 
- We learnt to build our chatbot

## What's next for Climatozon
We want to build our model to classify more waste items and can translate words into different languages.
